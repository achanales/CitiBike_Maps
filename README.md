# CitiBike_Maps

Data analysis and visualization using python. 

In the analysis I analyze CitiBike data from June 2018 - June 2019 and build a visulaztion of the most popular routes. I use *Pandas* for data manipulation and wrangling and *Folium* to produce interactive maps. 

The completed code can be found in the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) [file](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/achanales/CitiBike_Maps/blob/master/code/citibike.ipynb#). Click link for rendered version (nbviewer) of the notebook that contains interactive maps.
